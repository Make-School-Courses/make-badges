# Make Badges

Open Badges represent verifiable achievements you can earn. Badges represent a digital real world record of your skills. 

Each badge is an image combined with meta data that details the issuer, the acheivement, the recipient of the badge. 

Badges can be displayed anywhere you can put an image: in email, on your [LinkedIn profile](https://openbadges.tumblr.com/post/55809369771/how-to-display-your-open-badges-on-your-linkedin),  or on social media.
